# Techno-Gurdy
An emulation of a hurdy gurdy in ChucK using your keyboard as the key chest and your mouse as the tone wheel.

By default, the instrument is tuned to C major, with `ZXCVBNM,` for the third octave, `SDFGHJKL` for the fourth octave, `WERTYUIO` for the fifth octave, and `34567890` for the sixth octave. The mouse's middle button acts as a hold-to-mute.
